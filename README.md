### Introduction

This project is called Cat Casting: A JS node integrated project based around computer vision. Detecting screens which are connected to our server, which we will use to cast a game upon. The game is playable from the master device which also detects each indivual screen. The game will be casted in a perfect perspective relative to the master's position.
Throughout the final semester the addition of video playback and 3D VR of a cube were added to our project.

### About

This project was created in a group of six CS students at KU Leuven dept of CS. This project was our first introduction to computer vision and server/client communications hands on. The project served as our Bachelor's 'thesis' to round off our bachelor study for the course: 'Project and development' at the faculty of computer sciences.

### Papers

We wrote all scientific papers in overleaf(Latex). All of these pdfs will be stored under the foldername 'Papers'.
